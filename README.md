# HELLO WORLD REACT-RAILS BACK-END APP

This is a simple study project, Here I'm creating a rails API to provide data to a front-end app!


## EndPoints

I've added only one endpoint that's `/api/v1/greetings` this returns a random greeting message everytime it's called.

## Front-End App

Here's the the github repo for the [front-end part](https://github.com/nelsinofrancisco/hello-react-front-end),
and here you can see the [live preview](https://nelsino-hrfe.netlify.app/). Keep in mind that the response it's taking some time to load and that the route to get a greeting is `/greetings` in the front end app.
